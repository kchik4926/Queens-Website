# Citi Bike Proposal Project: Queens 
## Honors Assignment 13 - Project Webpage

### Introduction
This webpage features our group's citibike proposals in the neighborhood of Queens. Through the course of the semester, we utilized programs such a geojson and voronoi maps to help us decide where to best place citibikes in a chosen neighborhood. For Queens, the three neighborhoods we will look at are Maspeth, Sunnyside, and Elmhurst. 

### Walkability Scores:
Harlem: 9.7
Sunnyside: 9.6
Elmhurst: 9.5
Maspeth & Port Morris: 8.4 (tie)

According to FiveThirtyEight, for one-bedroom apartments, renters are willing to pay $56 more per month in rent to live a minute closer to the subway. The availability of CitiBikes will decrease commute time by making it easier and faster to get to the subway. Therefore, we can infer that the availability of CitiBikes will increase the prices of apartments in Maspeth. We ranked the price of housing as an important factor in ranking the neighborhoods because it limits the number of people who can afford to live there. The more expensive it is, the less accessible the neighborhood is to the general public. People do not want to pay for housing that will be too much of a financial burden. This means that with the presence of CitiBikes, the cost of living score for Maspeth will decrease. On the other hand, the transit score will increase as there are now more options for transportation and shorter commute time. Transit is obviously an important factor in ranking neighborhoods as well because New Yorkers are always on the go and commuting from one place to another. In Maspeth where the median age is 39, we can assume that a significant amount of people have to get to work on a daily basis, so it’s crucial for them to be able to travel quickly and conveniently. Hence, while the availability of CitiBikes will increase the price of living, it will benefit the approximately 54,905 people in Maspeth by making their commute a lot easier.

Reasoning: Based on commute data provided by Google Maps, CityMapper, and WNYC, along with rankings provided by various outlets such as Niche, we predict that the expansion of Citi Bike into Sunnyside may generally cause a moderate increase in rent prices, but otherwise have little effect. An analysis performed by FiveThirtyEight concluded that on average, New Yorkers are willing to pay about $56 more for each minute a commute is shortened by renting a given residence. This rule predicts only a low to moderate increase ($0 - $280) on rents in Sunnyside when CitiBike expands there, as there is generally less than a five minute difference between the time it takes to walk from a residence to the nearest train station and the time it takes to bike there -- for some residences, there is actually no difference at all. The further a residence is from the nearest train station, the greater the time difference between walking and biking. Of course, these commute times can vary somewhat based on different individuals’ walking and biking speeds, and these predictions assume that residents choose to take advantage of Citi Bike when it comes. It is also important to remember that while walking is free, there is a cost to using Citi Bike — $169 per year, or $14.95 per month with an annual commitment, which residents may not consider to be worth the little to no difference in commute time. With these slight increases, the cost of living in Sunnyside won’t become much more expensive than it already is, currently ranked by Niche as an abysmal D-. The general quality of life is also unlikely to see much change, as Sunnyside has already been ranked as one of the safest and most walkable neighborhoods by various media (the neighborhood earned an almost perfect walkability score of 9.6 from
